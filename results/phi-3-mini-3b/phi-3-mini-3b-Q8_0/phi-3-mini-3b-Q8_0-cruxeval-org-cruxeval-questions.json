However, if two consecutive numbers are identical (`prev == array[i]`), then according to our code logic, they should be removed. But there's a mistake here: when comparing with 'prev', which is the first element of the list (array[0]), we never actually remove it because `del newArray[i]` will always target an index that doesn\u2019t exist for this case (`newArray` starts as `[1, 2, 3]`, and after removing one item at a time starting from second position), hence no element is removed. The corrected logic should be to delete the current 'prev' instead of `array[i]`",
