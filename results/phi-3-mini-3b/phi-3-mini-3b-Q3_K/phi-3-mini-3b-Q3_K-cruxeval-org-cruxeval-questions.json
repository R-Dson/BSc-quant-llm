Since they are indeed both set as 1, we append '1' again. Secondly, if 'item1' (which is `2`) appears at the end of our array and it equals 'item2', then no action should be taken because this condition will never hold true with given input values [1, 1].

In our case, after removing 7 and 1 for elements [9,0] respectively from nums=[7,1,2,6,0,2], we will be left with an empty list. Hence the final result is [] (empty)",

Then, the values from this dictionary are extracted using list comprehension to form a new list containing only those elements (values). In our case, we have three key-value pairs: ('u', 1), ('s', 7), and ('u', -5). The function will create a dictionary {'u': 1, 's': 7, 'u': -5} from these tuples. However, since dictionaries cannot contain duplicate keys in Python (the second occurrence of the key 'u' would overwrite its previous value), we end up with only two unique values: [1, 7]. The correct output should be a list containing all three numbers without any duplicates or additional transformations as per our function definition. Therefore, to correctly reflect this behavior and avoid losing information due to dictionary properties in Python (where the last occurrence of duplicate keys overwrites previous ones), we need an approach that handles such scenarios properly:",
